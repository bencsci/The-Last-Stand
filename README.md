## Gameplay Features

- **Wave-Based System**: The game uses a wave-based system. At the start of each wave, enemies are spawned around the player, with the number of enemies increasing as the wave number rises. The wave ends once all enemies are defeated.

- **Point System**: Players earn points for every hit on an enemy. These points can be spent at the **Ice Cream Truck** to purchase weapons, ammo, and health packs.

- **Critical Hits**: When the player lands three consecutive shots, they deal a critical hit, resulting in bonus damage and points.

- **Fatal Shots**: The player earns more points for landing the fatal shot on an enemy. Critical fatal shots provide even more points.

- **Damage Indicators**: When the player lands a shot, damage text will appear above the enemy, showing how much damage was dealt.

- **Crosshair**: The crosshair follows the player's mouse movements. When aiming at an enemy, the crosshair turns **green**. When not aiming at an enemy, it remains **white**.

- **Hidden Notes**: Scattered around the map, these notes reveal bits of the game‚Äôs lore. Discovering these notes grants 100 points.

- **Ammo Drops**: Starting from the 5th round, enemies may drop ammo packs. Walking over them will replenish the player's ammo reserve.

- **Health Regeneration**: Health regenerates by 10 HP every 15 seconds for the first 9 rounds. After round 9, health can only be replenished by buying health packs at the **Food Truck**.
